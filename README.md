# WGAN-GP_FCCMPEAs
Accelerated Discovery of Corrosion-Resistant Multi-Principal Element Alloys

This repository provides the full implementation of a data-augmented machine learning framework for designing corrosion-resistant multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs). The workflow integrates Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) for synthetic data generation, predictive machine learning models for pitting-potential estimation, and Bayesian optimization for composition refinement across high-dimensional alloy spaces.
